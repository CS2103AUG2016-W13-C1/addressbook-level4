 The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
 command `add buy milk `.

>Note how both sequence diagrams are very similar. This is because of good separation of concerns between the different components.

Google Keep : Strength and Weaknesses
> Google Keep is an easy to use note taking application. It allows users to create different kinds of notes for different purposes. It also has some sort of a checklist which mimics the basic function of a to-do application. The user can also set reminders for a list but not for a specific task.

> A noticeable point about Google Keep is that there is no other way than a list to view the to-dos. Probably this is because Google has other forms of to-dos tracking application and Keep is just meant to be a lightweight option for users who do not need that much functionality.
